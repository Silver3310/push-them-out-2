# push-them-out-2

PushThemOut 2 — a revision of the original PushThemOut online co-op game, now
standalone (no server required) and rebuilt with HTML5 Canvas + ES modules.

## Running

The project is a static site. Open `index.html` via any local HTTP server, e.g.:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8765
# then visit http://localhost:8765/
```

## Project layout

- `index.html` / `css/style.css` — page shell hosting the canvas
- `src/core/` — `Game` orchestrator, `GameConfig`, top-level `GameState` enum
- `src/entities/` — players, enemies, and physics objects (balls, holes, planets, bullets)
- `src/events/` — shared `eventBus`, event names, raw input handler
- `src/logic/` — physics, collision detection, score manager, math utils
- `src/rendering/` — canvas renderer, camera, sprite manager
- `src/audio/` — Web Audio engine and event-driven audio manager
- `src/ui/` — UI screens (e.g. the main `Menu`)

## Game flow

The top-level state machine lives in `GameState`:

```
LOADING → MENU → PLAYING ⇄ PAUSED
                    ↓
                 VICTORY
```

`Menu` (in `src/ui/Menu.js`) drives the title screen with three options
— **Start the game**, **Rules**, and **About** — over an animated background
(twinkling stars, drifting pixel-stars, a slowly falling asteroid, and a
distant planet horizon). Selecting *Start the game* emits
`GameEvents.MENU_START_GAME`, which `Game` consumes to build the level and
switch to `PLAYING`.
